    "    Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A binary expression tree is a kind of binary tree used to represent arithmetic expressions. Each node of a binary expression tree has either zero or two children. Leaf nodes (nodes with 0 children) correspond to operands (numbers), and internal nodes (nodes with 2 children) correspond to the operators '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), '*' (multiplication), and '/' (division).\n",
    "\n",
    "    For each internal node with operator o, the infix expression that it represents is (A o B), where A is the expression the left subtree represents and B is the expression the right subtree represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You are given a string s, an infix expression containing operands, the operators described above, and parentheses '(' and ')'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return any valid binary expression tree, which its in-order traversal reproduces s after omitting the parenthesis from it (see examples below).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please note that order of operations applies in s. That is, expressions in parentheses are evaluated first, and multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Operands must also appear in the same order in both s and the in-order traversal of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"3*4-2*5\"\n",
    "    Output: [-,*,*,3,4,2,5]\n",
    "    Explanation: The tree above is the only valid tree whose inorder traversal produces s.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"2-3/(5*2)+1\"\n",
    "    Output: [+,-,1,2,/,null,null,null,null,3,*,null,null,5,2]\n",
    "    Explanation: The inorder traversal of the tree above is 2-3/5*2+1 which is the same as s without the parenthesis. The tree also produces the correct result and its operands are in the same order as they appear in s.\n",
    "    The tree below is also a valid binary expression tree with the same inorder traversal as s, but it not a valid answer because it does not evaluate to the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The third tree below is also not valid. Although it produces the same result and is equivalent to the above trees, its inorder traversal does not produce s and its operands are not in the same order as s.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"1+2+3+4+5\"\n",
    "    Output: [+,+,5,+,4,null,null,+,3,null,null,1,2]\n",
    "    Explanation: The tree [+,+,5,+,+,null,null,1,2,3,4] is also one of many other valid trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1 <= s.length <= 1000\n",
    "        s consists of digits and the characters '+', '-', '*', and '/'.\n",
    "        Operands in s are exactly 1 digit.\n",
    "        It is guaranteed that s is a valid expression."
