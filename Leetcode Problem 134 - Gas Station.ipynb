    "Problem Statement. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i]. <br/>\n",
    "You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations. <br/>\n",
    "Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: <br/>\n",
    "Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2] <br/>\n",
    "Output: 3 <br/>\n",
    "Explanation: <br/>\n",
    "Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3. <br/>\n",
    "Therefore, return 3 as the starting index. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: <br/>\n",
    "Input: gas = [2,3,4], cost = [3,4,3] <br/>\n",
    "Output: -1 <br/>\n",
    "Explanation: <br/>\n",
    "You can't start at station 0 or 1, as there is not enough gas to travel to the next station. <br/>\n",
    "Let's start at station 2 and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 0. Your tank = 4 - 3 + 2 = 3 <br/>\n",
    "Travel to station 1. Your tank = 3 - 3 + 3 = 3 <br/>\n",
    "You cannot travel back to station 2, as it requires 4 unit of gas but you only have 3. <br/>\n",
    "Therefore, you can't travel around the circuit once no matter where you start."
