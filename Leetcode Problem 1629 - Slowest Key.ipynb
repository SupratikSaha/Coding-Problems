    "Problem Statement. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A newly designed keypad was tested, where a tester pressed a sequence of n keys, one at a time. <br/>\n",
    "You are given a string keysPressed of length n, where keysPressed[i] was the ith key pressed in the testing sequence, and a sorted list releaseTimes, where releaseTimes[i] was the time the ith key was released. Both arrays are 0-indexed. The 0th key was pressed at the time 0, and every subsequent key was pressed at the exact time the previous key was released. <br/>\n",
    "The tester wants to know the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. The ith keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1], and the 0th keypress had a duration of releaseTimes[0]. <br/>\n",
    "Note that the same key could have been pressed multiple times during the test, and these multiple presses of the same key may not have had the same duration. <br/>\n",
    "Return the key of the keypress that had the longest duration. If there are multiple such keypresses, return the lexicographically largest key of the keypresses. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1: <br/>\n",
    "Input: releaseTimes = [9,29,49,50], keysPressed = \"cbcd\" <br/>\n",
    "Output: \"c\" <br/>\n",
    "Explanation: The keypresses were as follows: <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 9 (pressed at time 0 and released at time 9). <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'b' had a duration of 29 - 9 = 20 (pressed at time 9 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 29). <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'c' had a duration of 49 - 29 = 20 (pressed at time 29 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 49). <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 50 - 49 = 1 (pressed at time 49 right after the release of the previous character and released at time 50). <br/>\n",
    "The longest of these was the keypress for 'b' and the second keypress for 'c', both with duration 20. <br/>\n",
    "'c' is lexicographically larger than 'b', so the answer is 'c'. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2: <br/>\n",
    "Input: releaseTimes = [12,23,36,46,62], keysPressed = \"spuda\" <br/>\n",
    "Output: \"a\" <br/>\n",
    "Explanation: The keypresses were as follows: <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 's' had a duration of 12. <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'p' had a duration of 23 - 12 = 11. <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'u' had a duration of 36 - 23 = 13. <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'd' had a duration of 46 - 36 = 10. <br/>\n",
    "Keypress for 'a' had a duration of 62 - 46 = 16. <br/>\n",
    "The longest of these was the keypress for 'a' with duration 16."
