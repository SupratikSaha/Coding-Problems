    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a social group, there are n people, with unique integer ids from 0 to n-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a list of logs, where each logs[i] = [timestamp, id_A, id_B] contains a non-negative integer timestamp, and the ids of two different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each log represents the time in which two different people became friends.  Friendship is symmetric: if A is friends with B, then B is friends with A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that person A is acquainted with person B if A is friends with B, or A is a friend of someone acquainted with B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the earliest time for which every person became acquainted with every other person. Return -1 if there is no such earliest time.\n",

    "The first event occurs at timestamp = 20190101 and after 0 and 1 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3], [4], [5].\n",
    "The second event occurs at timestamp = 20190104 and after 3 and 4 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1], [2], [3,4], [5].\n",

    "The fourth event occurs at timestamp = 20190211 and after 1 and 5 become friends we have the following friendship groups [0,1,5], [2,3,4].\n",
    "The fifth event occurs at timestamp = 20190224 and as 2 and 4 are already friend anything happens.\n",
