    "Problem Statement. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the skyline formed by these buildings collectively. <br/>\n",
    "The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]: <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "    lefti is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.\n",
    "    righti is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.\n",
    "    heighti is the height of the ith building.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The skyline should be represented as a list of \"key points\" sorted by their x-coordinate in the form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour. <br/>\n",
    "Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...] <br/>\n",
