    "    You have some number of sticks with positive integer lengths. These lengths are given as an array sticks, where sticks[i] is the length of the ith stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You can connect any two sticks of lengths x and y into one stick by paying a cost of x + y. You must connect all the sticks until there is only one stick remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the minimum cost of connecting all the given sticks into one stick in this way.\n",
