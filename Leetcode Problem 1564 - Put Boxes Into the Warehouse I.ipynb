    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given two arrays of positive integers, boxes and warehouse, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of n rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labelled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where warehouse[i] (0-indexed) is the height of the ith room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Boxes cannot be stacked.\n",
    "    You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.\n",
    "    Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.\n",
    "    If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "We can first put the box of height 1 in room 4. Then we can put the box of height 3 in either of the 3 rooms 1, 2, or 3. Lastly, we can put one box of height 4 in room 0.\n",
    "There is no way we can fit all 4 boxes in the warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that it's not possible to put the box of height 4 into the warehouse since it cannot pass the first room of height 3.\n",
    "Also, for the last two rooms, 2 and 3, only boxes of height 1 can fit.\n",
    "We can fit 3 boxes maximum as shown above. The yellow box can also be put in room 2 instead.\n",
    "Swapping the orange and green boxes is also valid, or swapping one of them with the red box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: boxes = [1,2,3], warehouse = [1,2,3,4]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: Since the first room in the warehouse is of height 1, we can only put boxes of height 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: boxes = [4,5,6], warehouse = [3,3,3,3,3]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",

    "    1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 10^5\n",
