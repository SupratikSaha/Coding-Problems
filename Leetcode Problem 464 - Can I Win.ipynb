    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"100 game\" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10. The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.\n",

    "Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.\n",
    "The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.\n",
    "If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.\n",
    "The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.\n",
    "Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.\n",

    "Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0\n",
