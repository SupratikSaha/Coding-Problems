    "    - Imagine we split an array into m different sub-arrays. There can be several ways to do this split. Let us assume we take one possible split.\n",
    "    - In this particular split, we take the sum of each subarray j and call it S(j) where j is from 1 to m. Then we figure out the sub-array which has the maximum sum from all of these m different sums and call it max_sum(array, m).\n",
    "    - What is the least possible value of max_sum(array, m)? Answer will be max(array) - this must be obvious. The max(array) value must be in one of the m sub-arrays. The least possible amongst all possible m different sub-arrays would be a sub-array with a single element as the max(array).\n",
    "    - What is the maximum possible value of max_sum(array, m)? Answer will be sum(array) - a subarray with all elements.\n",
    "    - So the range of max_sum(array, m) is max(array) to sum(array).\n",
    "    - We now have a search problem - we need to search within the range max(array) to sum(array) such that we find the minimum value in this range with which we can form at-most m sub-arrays such no sub-array has sum more than this value. To efficiently search a sorted range we use binary search.\n",
    "    - Imagine we pick a value mid and find that we could make more sub-arrays than m. This means we picked too small value (check the code to understand this). We should set low = mid + 1.\n",
    "    - Imagine we pick a value mid and find we could make less sub-arrays than m. Now we can easily split those sub-arrays to increase the count and still make sure that the maximum sum of those sub-arrays is less than mid (splitting will only decrease mid). In this case, we record a potential solution and make high = mid-1, hoping to get an even better solution later.\n",
    "    - Lets use an example: [7,2,5,10,8] and 2\n",
    "    max_sum([7,2,5,10,8], 2) will be in the range [10, 32] - i.e. any split of the array into 2 sub-array will have sum of the sub-array between [10, 32].\n",
    "    - Now we want to find the minimum value in this range with which we can form 2 sub-arrays. Lets do this linearly. Can we use 10? Using 10, we can form [7, 2]; [5]; [10]; [8] - 4 subarrays. We clearly need to increase the minimum value so that we can reduce from 4 subarrays.\n",
    "    - What if we used binary search and started with mid = (10+32)/2 = 21. This gives us [7,2,5]; [10,8] - This is valid solution. Can we do better? We record 21 and reduce our range to [10, 20].\n",
    "    - This gives us mid as 15. [7,2,5]; [10]; [8] - Invalid! we got more than 2 sub-arrays. We need to increase low to mid+1 and search in the range [16, 20].\n",
    "    - [16, 20] gives us 18. [7,2,5]; [10,8] - This is a valid solution. Can we do better than 18? Let us search in the range [16,17]\n",
    "    - [16,17] gives mid as 16. [7,2,5]; [10]; [8]. This is invalid and we need to increase range. New range is [17,17]. This again gives [7,2,5]; [10]; [8] and we get the new range as [18,17].\n",
