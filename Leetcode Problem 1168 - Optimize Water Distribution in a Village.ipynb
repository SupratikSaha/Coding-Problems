    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are n houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each house i, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost wells[i - 1] (note the -1 due to 0-indexing), or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array pipes, where each pipes[j] = [house1j, house2j, costj] represents the cost to connect house1j and house2j together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional.\n",

    "Explanation: \n",
    "The image shows the costs of connecting houses using pipes.\n",
    "The best strategy is to build a well in the first house with cost 1 and connect the other houses to it with cost 2 so the total cost is 3.\n",
