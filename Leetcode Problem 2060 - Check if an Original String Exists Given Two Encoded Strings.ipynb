    "\n",
    "An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.\n",
    "    Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).\n",
    "    Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one way to encode an original string \"abcdefghijklmnop\" might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Split it as a sequence: [\"ab\", \"cdefghijklmn\", \"o\", \"p\"].\n",
    "    Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [\"ab\", \"12\", \"1\", \"p\"].\n",
    "    Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: \"ab121p\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.\n",
