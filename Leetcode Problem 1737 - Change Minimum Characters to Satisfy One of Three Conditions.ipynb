    "\n",
    "You are given two strings a and b that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in a or b to any lowercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to satisfy one of the following three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every letter in a is strictly less than every letter in b in the alphabet.\n",
    "    Every letter in b is strictly less than every letter in a in the alphabet.\n",
    "    Both a and b consist of only one distinct letter.\n",

    "Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve your goal.\n",

    "Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:\n",
    "1) Change b to \"ccc\" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.\n",
    "2) Change a to \"bbb\" and b to \"aaa\" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.\n",
    "3) Change a to \"aaa\" and b to \"aaa\" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.\n",
