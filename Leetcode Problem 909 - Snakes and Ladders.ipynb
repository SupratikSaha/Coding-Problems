    "    Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "    On an N x N board, the numbers from 1 to N*N are written boustrophedonically starting from the bottom left of the board, and alternating direction each row.  For example, for a 6 x 6 board, the numbers are written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    You start on square 1 of the board (which is always in the last row and first column).  Each move, starting from square x, consists of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "        You choose a destination square S with number x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4, x+5, or x+6, provided this number is <= N*N.\n",
    "            (This choice simulates the result of a standard 6-sided die roll: ie., there are always at most 6 destinations, regardless of the size of the board.)\n",
    "        If S has a snake or ladder, you move to the destination of that snake or ladder.  Otherwise, you move to S.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A board square on row r and column c has a \"snake or ladder\" if board[r][c] != -1.  The destination of that snake or ladder is board[r][c].\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that you only take a snake or ladder at most once per move: if the destination to a snake or ladder is the start of another snake or ladder, you do not continue moving.  (For example, if the board is `[[4,-1],[-1,3]]`, and on the first move your destination square is `2`, then you finish your first move at `3`, because you do not continue moving to `4`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the least number of moves required to reach square N*N.  If it is not possible, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: [\n",
    "    [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n",
    "    [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n",

    "    [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1],\n",
    "    [-1,15,-1,-1,-1,-1]]\n",
    "    Output: 4\n",
    "    Explanation: \n",
    "    At the beginning, you start at square 1 [at row 5, column 0].\n",
    "    You decide to move to square 2, and must take the ladder to square 15.\n",
    "    You then decide to move to square 17 (row 3, column 5), and must take the snake to square 13.\n",
    "    You then decide to move to square 14, and must take the ladder to square 35.\n",
    "    You then decide to move to square 36, ending the game.\n",
    "    It can be shown that you need at least 4 moves to reach the N*N-th square, so the answer is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "        2 <= board.length = board[0].length <= 20\n",
    "        board[i][j] is between 1 and N*N or is equal to -1.\n",
    "        The board square with number 1 has no snake or ladder.\n",
    "        The board square with number N*N has no snake or ladder."
