    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children\n",
    "    The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.\n",
    "    The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]\n",
    "Output: [2,7,4]\n",
    "Explanation: We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.\n",
    "The nodes coloured in blue are the deepest leaf-nodes of the tree.\n",
    "Note that nodes 6, 0, and 8 are also leaf nodes, but the depth of them is 2, but the depth of nodes 7 and 4 is 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [1]\n",
    "Output: [1]\n",
    "Explanation: The root is the deepest node in the tree, and it's the lca of itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [0,1,3,null,2]\n",
    "Output: [2]\n",
    "Explanation: The deepest leaf node in the tree is 2, the lca of one node is itself.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [1, 1000].\n",
    "    0 <= Node.val <= 1000\n",
    "    The values of the nodes in the tree are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
