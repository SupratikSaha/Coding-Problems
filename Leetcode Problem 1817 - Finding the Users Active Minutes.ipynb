    "Problem Statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer k. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array logs where each logs[i] = [IDi, timei] indicates that the user with IDi performed an action at the minute timei.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple users can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform multiple actions in the same minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user active minutes (UAM) for a given user is defined as the number of unique minutes in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are to calculate a 1-indexed array answer of size k such that, for each j (1 <= j <= k), answer[j] is the number of users whose UAM equals j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the array answer as described above.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: logs = [[0,5],[1,2],[0,2],[0,5],[1,3]], k = 5\n",
    "Output: [0,2,0,0,0]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The user with ID=0 performed actions at minutes 5, 2, and 5 again. Hence, they have a UAM of 2 (minute 5 is only counted once).\n",
    "The user with ID=1 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\n",
    "Since both users have a UAM of 2, answer[2] is 2, and the remaining answer[j] values are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]], k = 4\n",
    "Output: [1,1,0,0]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The user with ID=1 performed a single action at minute 1. Hence, they have a UAM of 1.\n",
    "The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3. Hence, they have a UAM of 2.\n",
    "There is one user with a UAM of 1 and one with a UAM of 2.\n",
    "Hence, answer[1] = 1, answer[2] = 1, and the remaining values are 0.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1 <= logs.length <= 10^4\n",
    "    0 <= IDi <= 10^9\n",
    "    1 <= timei <= 10^5\n",
    "    k is in the range [The maximum UAM for a user, 10^5]."
